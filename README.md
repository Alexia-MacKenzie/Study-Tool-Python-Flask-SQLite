Revision Tracker and Planner

This application tracks revision sessions, and allows users to log and plan revision sessions, with the ability to view their previous session history.


Overview:

What the app does

This web application allows users to plan their own revision session, run a timer during a session and log these completed session using a database.



Who it’s for

This web application is designed for anyone who wishes to track and manage their revision sessions. It is particularly useful for:
- Students who are revising for exams and in class tests
- Anyone who wishes to monitor educational progress and maintain a consistent learning routine

Users of this app can easily add and view their study sessions, as well as track their hours spent revising certain topics, allowing users to stay organised and driven with their learning.

What problem it solves


Motivation

I built this application in order to use it myself. It will help me plan my study sessions for each of modules effectively, and will allow me to see what timings I have allocated each of my modules, so that I can plan in accordance to what tests/ courseworks I have coming up. I feel this is a useful application to produce for myself but also for my friends and family, who also struggle to plan their study sessions. I also wanted to expand my python knowledge and database skills, so by implementing Flask and SQLite in this project, I am able to fulfill these goal.

Features:
- Plan future revision sessions
- View previous revision sessions
- Run a timer during revision sessions
- Log completed revision sessions


Tech stack
- Python
- Flask
- SQLite
- HTML / CSS
- JavaScript

How it works (high level)

Challenges and Learning

For this project to work, I had to learn quite a few new skills. Firstly, I have never used virtual environments and Flask, so that was quite a steep learning curve for me. However, I have now gained quite an insight into Flask, and feel confident with the frameworks it provides. It was quite fun to experiement with Flask, and very rewarding when testing the code and discovering my functionalities worked! I also have minimal experience with HTML forms and JavaScript, so the displaying of the timer proved to be quite a difficult step in the programming process.
